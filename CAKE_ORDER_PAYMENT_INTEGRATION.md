## Cash Up Integration

### Deposits Tracked Separately
- `Demo_CakeOrder_Payments` table has `IsDeposit` flag
- Cash Up query will sum deposits separately:
  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(PaymentAmount) 
  FROM Demo_CakeOrder_Payments
  WHERE IsDeposit = 1 
    AND CAST(PaymentDate AS DATE) = @Date
    AND CashierID = @CashierID
  ```

### Balance Payments (On Pickup)
- When customer picks up and pays balance
- Another payment record created with `IsDeposit = 0`
- Order marked as `IsDelivered = 1`
- Full sale recorded in `Demo_Sales`
